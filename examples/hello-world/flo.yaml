# This is the most basic flo.yaml specification. every task YAML
# object (separated by `---`) contains a `creates` target, which
# specifies the file that should be created after the `command`s are
# run. `command` can either be a sequence of steps or a standalone
# command. Each `command` is treated as a jinja template that uses the
# other key/value pairs in the task's YAML object to fill in the
# blanks.

# create some data to analyze.
---
creates: data/hello_world.txt
command:
  - mkdir -p $(dirname {{creates}})
  - for i in $(seq 1 100); do echo $i hello world; done > {{creates}}

# do a word count

creates: data/word_count.dat
depends: data/hello_world.txt
command: tr ' ' '\n' < {{depends}} | sort | uniq -c > {{creates}}
